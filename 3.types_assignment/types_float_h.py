* Assignment: Type Float Gradient
* Required: no
* Complexity: hard
* Lines of code: 7 lines
* Time: 8 min

English:
    1. At what altitude above sea level, pressure is equal
       to partial pressure of Oxygen
    2. Print result in meters rounding to two decimal places
    3. To calculate partial pressure use ratio
       (100% is 1013.25 hPa, 20.946% is how many hPa?)
    4. Calculated altitude is pressure at sea level minus
       oxygen partial pressure divided by gradient
    5. Mind the operator precedence
    6. Run doctests - all must succeed

Hints:
    * pressure gradient (decrease) = 11.3 Pa / 1 m
    * 1 hPa = 100 Pa
    * 1 kPa = 1000 Pa
    * 1 ata = 1013.25 hPa (ISA - International Standard Atmosphere)
    * Atmosphere gas composition:

        * Nitrogen 78.084%
        * Oxygen 20.946%
        * Argon 0.9340%
        * Carbon Dioxide 0.0407%
        * Others 0.001%

Tests:

    'Assign your result to variable `pO2`'
    >>> assert gradient is not Ellipsis, \
    'Assign your result to variable `gradient`'
    >>> assert altitude is not Ellipsis, \
    'Assign your result to variable `altitude`'
    >>> assert type(pO2) is float, \
    'Variable `pO2` has invalid type, should be float'
    >>> assert type(gradient) is float, \
    'Variable `gradient` has invalid type, should be float'
    >>> assert type(altitude) is float, \
    'Variable `altitude` has invalid type, should be float'

    >>> gradient
    11.3
    >>> round(altitude/m, 2)
