English:
    1. Calculate altitude in meters:
        a. Armstrong Limit: 19 km
        b. Stratosphere: 20 km
        c. USAF Space Line: 80 km
        d. IAF Space Line: 100 km
    2. Run doctests - all must succeed

References:
    * USAF - United States Air Force
    * IAF - International Astronautical Federation
    * KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line (100 km) - boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space
    * Armstrong limit (19 km) - altitude above which atmospheric pressure is
      sufficiently low that water boils at the temperature of the human body

Hints:
    * 1 km = 1000 m
    * Use // to get floor division as int

Tests:
    >>> import sys; sys.tracebacklimit = 0

    'Assign your result to variable `armstrong_limit`'

    >>> assert usaf_space is not Ellipsis, \
    'Assign your result to variable `usaf_space`'
    >>> assert iaf_space is not Ellipsis, \
    'Assign your result to variable `iaf_space`'
    >>> assert type(armstrong_limit) is int, \
