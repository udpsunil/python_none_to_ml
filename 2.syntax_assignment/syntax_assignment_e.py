* Assignment: Syntax Variables None
* Complexity: easy
* Lines of code: 1 lines
* Time: 2 min

English:
    1. Define variable `result` with value None
    2. Run doctests - all must succeed

Hint:
    * Note that None is capitalized

Tests:
    >>> import sys; sys.tracebacklimit = 0

    >>> assert result is not Ellipsis, \
    'Assign your result to variable `result`'
    >>> assert type(result) is type(None), \
    'Variable `result` has invalid type, should be None'
    >>> assert result is None, \
    'Variable `result` has invalid value, should be None'

# With value None
# type: None
