English:
    1. Define variable `result` with value 1.2
    2. Run doctests - all must succeed

Tests:
    >>> import sys; sys.tracebacklimit = 0

    >>> assert result is not Ellipsis, \
    'Assign your result to variable `result`'
    >>> assert type(result) is float, \
    'Variable `result` has invalid type, should be float'
    >>> assert result == 1.2, \
    'Variable `result` has invalid value, should be 1.2'

# with value 1.2
